This is a work-in-progress to create an easy to use client REST API for
Zenoss (http://www.zenoss.com) written in Ruby.  I love Zenoss as a
product, but I am much more efficient in Ruby than Python so I decided
to start hacking this library together.  It is very incomplete and I am
just adding functionality as I need it or it is requested.

Cheers,
